This issue affects MongoDB Server v4.0 versions prior to 4.0.9; MongoDB Server v3.6 versions prior to 3.6.13 and MongoDB Server v3.4 versions prior to 3.4.22.\n\nWorkaround: \nAfter deleting one or more users, restart any nodes which may have had active user authorization sessions.\n\nRefrain from creating user accounts with the same name as previously deleted accounts.\n\n"
