An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how virtual machines access the Hyper-V Network Switch.\n"
