The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IPv6 packets through the UTD feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv6 traffic through an affected device that is configured with UTD. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
