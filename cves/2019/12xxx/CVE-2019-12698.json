The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for a specific WebVPN HTTP page request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN HTTP page load requests for a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, which could cause traffic to be delayed through the device."
