The vulnerability is due to the presence of unnecessary debug commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining unrestricted access to the restricted shell and using the specific debug commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enable the microphone of an affected device to record audio without notifying users."
