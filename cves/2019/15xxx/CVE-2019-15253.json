        "value": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software releases earlier than 1.3.0.6 and 1.3.1.4."
