The vulnerability exists because the software lacks proper authentication controls to information accessible from the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web UI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive device information, which includes configuration files."
