A manipulated PC Worx or Config+ project file could lead to an Out-of-bounds Read and remote code execution. The attacker needs to get access to an original PC Worx or Config+ project to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation, the attacker needs to exchange the original files with the manipulated ones on the application programming workstation."
