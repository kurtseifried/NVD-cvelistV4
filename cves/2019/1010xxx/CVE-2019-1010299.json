The impact is: Contents of uninitialized memory could be printed to string or to log file. The component is: Debug trait implementation for std::collections::vec_deque::Iter. The attack vector is: The program needs to invoke debug printing for iterator over an empty VecDeque. The fixed version is: 1.30.0, nightly versions after commit b85e4cc8fadaabd41da5b9645c08c68b8f89908d."
