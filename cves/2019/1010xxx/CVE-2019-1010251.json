The impact is: An attacker can evade a signature detection with a specialy formed network packet. The component is: app-layer-detect-proto.c, decode.c, decode-teredo.c and decode-ipv6.c (https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3590/commits/11f3659f64a4e42e90cb3c09fcef66894205aefe, https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3590/commits/8357ef3f8ffc7d99ef6571350724160de356158b). The attack vector is: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted network request. The fixed version is: 4.1.2."
