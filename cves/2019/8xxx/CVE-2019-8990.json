This possibility is restricted to circumstances where HTTP \"Basic Authentication\" policy is used in conjunction with an XML Authentication resource. The BusinessWorks engine might instead use credentials from a prior HTTP request for authorization purposes. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc. TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks: versions up to and including 6.4.2."
