Affected versions of the software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability can be triggered if a large HTTP request is sent to the executing service. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise availability of the service provided by the software."
