The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of an affected CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging the insufficient restrictions during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root."
