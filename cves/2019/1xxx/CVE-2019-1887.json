The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of input SIP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SIP packet to an affected Cisco Unified Communications Manager. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a new registration process on all connected phones, temporarily disrupting service."
