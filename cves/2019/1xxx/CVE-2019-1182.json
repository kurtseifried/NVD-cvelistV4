This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target systems Remote Desktop Service via RDP.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Remote Desktop Services handles connection requests.\n"
