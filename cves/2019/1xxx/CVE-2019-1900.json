The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to certain endpoints of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the web server to crash. Physical access to the device may be required for a restart."
