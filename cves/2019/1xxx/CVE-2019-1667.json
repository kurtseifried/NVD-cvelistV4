The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the Graphite service and sending arbitrary data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary data to Graphite, which could result in invalid statistics being presented in the interface. Versions prior to 3.5(2a) are affected."
