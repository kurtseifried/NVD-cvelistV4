An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the DHCP service to become nonresponsive.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a DHCP server. However, the DHCP server must be set to failover mode for the attack to succeed.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how DHCP failover servers handle network packets.\n"
