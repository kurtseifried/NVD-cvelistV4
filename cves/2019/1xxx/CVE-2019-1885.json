The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted authenticated commands to the web-based management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root privileges."
