The vulnerability is due to incorrect permissions settings on affected DCNM software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the web-based management interface of an affected device and requesting specific URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download arbitrary files from the underlying filesystem of the affected device."
