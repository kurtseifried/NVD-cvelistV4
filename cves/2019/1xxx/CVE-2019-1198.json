An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run.  However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a remote code execution vulnerability and another elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the SyncController.dll handles processes these requests.\n"
