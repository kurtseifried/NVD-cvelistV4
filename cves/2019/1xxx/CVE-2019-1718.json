The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. An successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects version 2.1."
