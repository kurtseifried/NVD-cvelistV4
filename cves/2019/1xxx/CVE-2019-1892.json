The vulnerability is due to improper validation of HTTPS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTPS packet to the management web interface of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
