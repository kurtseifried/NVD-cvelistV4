The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain IPv4 packet streams that are sent through the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packet streams through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to either cause an interface queue wedge or a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition."
