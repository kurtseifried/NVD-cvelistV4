An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could leverage a customizer privilege within Dynamics to gain control of the Web Role hosting the Dynamics installation.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have credentials for a user that has permission to author customized business rules in Dynamics, and persist XAML script in a way that causes it to be interpreted as code.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by restricting XAML activities to a whitelisted set.\n"
