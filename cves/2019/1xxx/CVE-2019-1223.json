An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the RDP service on the target system to stop responding.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to run a specially crafted application against a server which provides Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how RDP handles connection requests.\n"
