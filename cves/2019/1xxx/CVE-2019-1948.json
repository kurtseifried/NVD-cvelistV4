The vulnerability is due to insufficient SSL certificate validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted SSL certificate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software."
