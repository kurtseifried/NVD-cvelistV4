The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the save command in the CLI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying the save command in the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device and escalate their privileges to the root user."
