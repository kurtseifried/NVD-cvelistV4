The vulnerability is due to the processing of malformed smart probe packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted smart probe packets at the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack on an affected system."
