An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially set certain items to run at a higher level and thereby elevate permissions.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control of an affected system.\nThe update addresses this vulnerability by correcting unprotected COM calls.\n"
