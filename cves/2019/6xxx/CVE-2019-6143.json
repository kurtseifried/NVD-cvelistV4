The vulnerability affects the following NGFW features when the LDAP authentication method is used as the backend authentication: IPsec VPN, SSL VPN or Browser-based user authentication. The vulnerability does not apply when any other backend authentication is used. The RADIUS authentication method is not vulnerable, for example."
