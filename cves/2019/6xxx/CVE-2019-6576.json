An attacker with network access to affected devices could potentially obtain a TLS session key. If the attacker is able to observe TLS traffic between a legitimate user and the device, then the attacker could decrypt the TLS traffic. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the web interface of the device and who is able to observe TLS traffic between legitimate users and the web interface of the affected device. The vulnerability could impact the confidentiality of the communication between the affected device and a legitimate user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of the security vulnerability was known."
