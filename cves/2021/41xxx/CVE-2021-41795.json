By targeting a vulnerable component of this extension, a malicious web page could read a subset of 1Password vault items that would normally be fillable by the user on that web page. These items are usernames and passwords for vault items associated with its domain, usernames and passwords without a domain association, credit cards, and contact items. (1Password must be unlocked for these items to be accessible, but no further user interaction is required.)"
