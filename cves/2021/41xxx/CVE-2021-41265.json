The issue allows for a malicious actor with a carefully crafted request to successfully authenticate and gain access to existing protected REST API endpoints. This only affects non database authentication types and new REST API endpoints. Users should upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.3.4 to receive a patch."
