In affected versions the package is vulnerable to YAML deserialization attack caused by unsafe loading which leads to Arbitary code execution. This security bug is patched by avoiding unsafe loader users should update to version above v1.1.0. If upgrading is not possible then users can change the Loader used to SafeLoader as a workaround. See commit 507d066ef432ea27d3e201da08009872a2f37725 for details."
