The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The name of the patch is 58922c345d3d1fe89bb2020111873a3e07ca93ac. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. VDB-216746 is the identifier assigned to this vulnerability. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: We do assume that the Data Manager server can only be accessed by authorised users. Because of this, we don\u2019t believe this specific attack is possible without such a compromise of the Data Manager server."
