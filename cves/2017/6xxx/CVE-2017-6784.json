        "value": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV340, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to Cisco WebEx Meetings not sufficiently protecting sensitive data when responding to an HTTP request to the web interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by attempting to use the HTTP protocol and looking at the data in the HTTP responses from the Cisco WebEx Meetings Server. An exploit could allow the attacker to find sensitive information about the application. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve37988. Known Affected Releases: firmware 1.0.0.30, 1.0.0.33, 1.0.1.9, 1.0.1.16."
