The vulnerability is due to a lack of flow-control mechanisms within the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of SIP INVITE packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability of services and data of the device, including a complete DoS condition. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco TC and CE platforms when running software versions prior to TC 7.3.8 and CE 8.3.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCux94002."
