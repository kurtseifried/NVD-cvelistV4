An attacker who can access the web interface of Fisheye or Crucible or who hosts a website that a user who can access the web interface of Fisheye or Crucible visits, is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Fisheye or Crucible. All versions of Fisheye and Crucible before 4.4.5 (the fixed version for 4.4.x) and from 4.5.0 before 4.5.2 (the fixed version for 4.5.x) are affected by this vulnerability."
