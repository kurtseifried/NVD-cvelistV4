This vulnerability is an instance of a security bypass vulnerability for a certain file-type extension. Acrobat maintains both a blacklist and whitelist (the user can specify an allowed attachment). However, any file extensions that are neither on the blacklist nor the whitelist can still be opened after displaying a warning prompt."
