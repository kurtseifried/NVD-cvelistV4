The vulnerability is due to insufficient NAM policy enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating network interfaces of the device to allow multiple active network interfaces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send traffic over a non-authorized network interface. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf66539."
