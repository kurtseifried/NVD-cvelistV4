An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted DLL file in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting App. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
