The vulnerability is due to insufficient NX-OS signature verification for software images. An authenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass signature verification and load a crafted, unsigned software image on a targeted device. The attacker would need valid administrator credentials to perform this exploit. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Unified Computing System Manager. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf25045, CSCvf31495."
