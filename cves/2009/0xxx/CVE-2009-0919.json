NOTE: this was originally reported as a problem in DFLabs PTK, but this issue affects any product that is installed within the XAMPP environment, and should not be viewed as a vulnerability within that product. NOTE: DFLabs states that PTK is intended for use in a laboratory with \"no contact from / to internet.\""
