The vulnerability affects versions 2.0.0.3 and earlier of SOY Inquiry. This allows remote attackers to force the administrator to edit files once the administrator loads a specially crafted webpage. An administrator must be logged in for exploitation to be possible. This issue is fixed in SOY Inquiry version 2.0.0.4 and included in SOY CMS 3.0.2.328."
