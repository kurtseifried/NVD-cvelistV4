The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands or scripts with root privileges on the affected device."
