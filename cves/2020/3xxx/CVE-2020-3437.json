The vulnerability is due to insufficient file scope limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specific file reference on the filesystem and then accessing it through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the underlying operating system."
