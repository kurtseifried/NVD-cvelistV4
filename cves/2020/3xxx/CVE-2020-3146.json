The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user."
