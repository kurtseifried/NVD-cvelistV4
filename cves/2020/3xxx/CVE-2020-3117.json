The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL and receive a malicious HTTP response. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into valid HTTP responses sent to a user's browser."
