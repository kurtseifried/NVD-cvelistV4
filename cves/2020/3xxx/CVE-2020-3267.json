The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system with valid agent credentials and performing a specific API call with crafted input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the availability state of an agent, potentially causing a denial of service condition."
