The vulnerability is due to improper traffic filtering conditions on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious TCP packet with specific characteristics and sending it to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the L3 and L4 traffic filters and inject an arbitrary packet into the network."
