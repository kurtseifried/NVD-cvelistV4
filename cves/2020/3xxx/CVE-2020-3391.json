The vulnerability is due to insecure storage of certain unencrypted credentials on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing the network device configuration and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices."
