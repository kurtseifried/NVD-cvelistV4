An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker could connect an imaging device (camera, scanner, cellular phone) to an affected system and run a specially crafted application to disclose information.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the WIA Service handles objects in memory.\n"
