An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the RD Gateway service on the target system to stop responding.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to run a specially crafted application against a server which provides RD Gateway services.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how RD Gateway handles connection requests.\n"
