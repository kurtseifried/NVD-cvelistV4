An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.\n"
