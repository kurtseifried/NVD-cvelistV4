This issue only affects the NFX250 Series vSRX VNF. No other products or platforms are affected. This issue is only applicable to environments where the vSRX VNF root password has not been configured. This issue affects the Juniper Networks NFX250 Network Services Platform vSRX VNF instance on versions prior to 19.2R1."
