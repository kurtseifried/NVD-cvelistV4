An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted script or application.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Print Spooler Component writes to the file system.\n"
