An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to run a specially crafted application against an RPC server which has Routing and Remote Access enabled. Routing and Remote Access is a non-default configuration; systems without it enabled are not vulnerable.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Routing and Remote Access service handles requests.\n"
