Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of firmware updates. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the firmware image prior to performing an upgrade. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9648."
