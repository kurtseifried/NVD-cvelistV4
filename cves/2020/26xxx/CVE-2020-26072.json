The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization in the SOAP API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending SOAP API requests to affected devices for devices that are outside their authorized domain. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and modify information on devices that belong to a different domain."
