The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter trusts the string length provided in the data section of the PRG file. It allocates memory for the string immediately, and then copies the string into the TVM object by using a function similar to strcpy. This copy can exceed the length of the allocated string data and overwrite heap data. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment."
