It increases the user's balance with the value of an unconfirmed transaction as soon as it is received (before the transaction is confirmed) and does not decrease the balance when it is canceled. As a result, users are exposed to basic double spending attacks, amplified double spending attacks, and DoS attacks without user consent."
