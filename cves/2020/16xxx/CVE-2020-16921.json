An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.</p>\n<p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and open a specially crafted file.</p>\n<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Text Services Framework handles objects in memory.</p>\n"
