If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an adversary to modify the system, leading to the arbitrary execution of code. This vulnerability is only exploitable if an attacker has access to an authenticated session. GE Digital CIMPLICITY v11.0, released January 2020, contains mitigation for this local privilege escalation vulnerability. GE Digital recommends all users upgrade to GE CIMPLICITY v11.0 or newer."
