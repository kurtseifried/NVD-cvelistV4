By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the \u201cRecord Data Size\u201d field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the \u201cTotal Record Size\u201d that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot.
