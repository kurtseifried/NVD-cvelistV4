        "value": "Revive Adserver before 3.2.3 suffers from Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress."
