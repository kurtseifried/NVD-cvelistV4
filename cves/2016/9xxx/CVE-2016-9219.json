The vulnerability is due to incomplete IPv6 UDP header validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 UDP packet to a specific port on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability of the device as it could unexpectedly reload. This vulnerability affects Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) running software version 8.2.121.0 or 8.3.102.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva98592."
