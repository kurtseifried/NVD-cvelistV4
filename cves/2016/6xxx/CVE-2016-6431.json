The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted packets during the enrollment operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted enrollment request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the reload of the affected system. Note: Only HTTPS packets directed to the Cisco ASA interface, where the local CA is allowing user enrollment, can be used to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode."
