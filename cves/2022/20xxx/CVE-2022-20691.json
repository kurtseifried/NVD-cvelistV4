An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to exhaust available memory and cause the service to restart.\r\n Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.  \r\n"
