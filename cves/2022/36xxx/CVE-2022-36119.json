In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for a domain authenticated user to send a crafted message to the Blue Prism Server and accomplish a remote code execution attack that is possible because of insecure deserialization. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows for code to be executed in the context of the Blue Prism Server service."
