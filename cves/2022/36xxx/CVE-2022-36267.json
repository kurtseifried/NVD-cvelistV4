The ping functionality can be called without user authentication when crafting a malicious http request by injecting code in one of the parameters allowing for remote code execution. This vulnerability is exploited via the binary file /home/www/cgi-bin/diagnostics.cgi that accepts unauthenticated requests and unsanitized data. As a result, a malicious actor can craft a specific request and interact remotely with the device."
