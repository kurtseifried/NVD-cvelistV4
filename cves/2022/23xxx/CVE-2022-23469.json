Versions prior to 2.9.6 are subject to a potential vulnerability in Traefik displaying the Authorization header in its debug logs. In certain cases, if the log level is set to DEBUG, credentials provided using the Authorization header are displayed in the debug logs. Attackers must have access to a users logging system in order for credentials to be stolen. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the log level to `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`."
