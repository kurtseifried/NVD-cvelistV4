Path Traversal in the kustomize-controller via a malicious `kustomization.yaml` allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service at the controller level. Workarounds include automated tooling in the user's CI/CD pipeline to validate `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies. This vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0. Users are recommended to upgrade."
