This was remediated by sanitizing /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesn\u2019t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
