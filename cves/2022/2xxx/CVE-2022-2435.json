This is due to missing nonce protection on the createDOMStructure() function found in the ~/anymind-widget-id.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site\u2019s administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link."
