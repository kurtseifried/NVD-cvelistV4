This user can make use of an open naming and directory API to access services that could perform unauthorized operations. The vulnerability affects local users and data, leading to a considerable impact on confidentiality as well as availability and a limited impact on the integrity of the application. These operations can be used to:\n\n  *  Read any information\n  *  Modify sensitive information\n  *  Denial of Service attacks (DoS)\n  *  SQL Injection\n\n\n\n\n"
