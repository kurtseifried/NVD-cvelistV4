Contracts using the cross chain utilities for Arbitrum L2, `CrossChainEnabledArbitrumL2` or `LibArbitrumL2`, will classify direct interactions of externally owned accounts (EOAs) as cross chain calls, even though they are not started on L1. This issue has been patched in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."
