        "value": "A vulnerability in the configuration and management service of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with vmanage user privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions to the HTTP management interface of the affected solution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the affected management service through an authenticated device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with vmanage user privileges or stop HTTP services on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a release of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution prior to Release 18.3.0: vBond Orchestrator Software, vEdge 100 Series Routers, vEdge 1000 Series Routers, vEdge 2000 Series Routers, vEdge 5000 Series Routers, vEdge Cloud Router Platform, vManage Network Management Software, vSmart Controller Software.
