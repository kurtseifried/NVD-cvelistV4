The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input of an affected client. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing arbitrary JavaScript in the Jabber client of the recipient. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the targeted client or allow the attacker to access sensitive client-based information."
