        "value": "A vulnerability in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, network attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a limitation in the way the FIB is internally representing recursive routes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting routes into the routing protocol that have a specific recursive pattern. The attacker must be in a position on the network that provides the ability to inject a number of recursive routes with a specific pattern. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, creating a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva91655."
