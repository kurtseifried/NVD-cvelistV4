The vulnerability is due to the incorrect inclusion of saved passwords in configuration pages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the Cisco Unified Communications Manager web-based management interface and viewing the source code for the configuration page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to recover passwords and expose those accounts to further attack."
