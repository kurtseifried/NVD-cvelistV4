The vulnerability is due to a lack of flow-control mechanisms in the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending high volumes of SIP INVITE traffic to the targeted device. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause a disruption of services on the targeted IP phone. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve10064, CSCve14617, CSCve14638, CSCve14683, CSCve20812, CSCve20926, CSCve20945."
