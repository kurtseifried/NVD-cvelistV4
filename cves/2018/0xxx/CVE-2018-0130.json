The vulnerability is due to the presence of static default credentials for the web-based service portal of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by extracting the credentials from an image of the affected software and using those credentials to generate a valid administrative session token for the web-based service portal of any other installation of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based service portal of an affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg30884."
