The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension during TLS connection setup for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS connection setup request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort detection engine on the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg97808."
