This vulnerability occurs as a result of computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of the image conversion engine when processing Enhanced Metafile Format (EMF) data that embeds an image in the bitmap (BMP) file format. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure."
