The ClearPass OnConnect feature permits administrators to link other network devices into ClearPass for the purpose of collecting enhanced information about connected endpoints. A defect in the API could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on one of the linked devices. This vulnerability is only applicable if credentials for devices have been supplied to ClearPass under Configuration -> Network -> Devices -> CLI Settings. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.5 and 6.6.10-hotfix."
