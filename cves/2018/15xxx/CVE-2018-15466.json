The attacker would need to have access to the internal VLAN where CPS is deployed. The vulnerability is due to lack of authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly connecting to the Graphite web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access various statistics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the Cisco Policy Suite environment."
